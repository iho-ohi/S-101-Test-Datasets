## Exports 
This folder holds exports of all new S-164 test datasets wrapped in S-100 edition 5.0.0 conformant CATALOG.XML

## Notes
* No encryption has been applied
* Files have been signed using a generated key and self-signed certificate. These are valid but will need to be replaced at some point
* Metadata for some files is transformed from edition 4.0.0 metadata. No metadata was available for other cells so a minimal (but conformant) set has been derived.
* issue dates need to be checked. Contents should also be double checked with what's in the repository to check they're the same.
* CAT.SIG has similarly been created - it is valid but self-signed.
* This exchange set will be upgraded if content is changed (this is done manually though so best to raise an issue when commits are done)
* The producer and address etc need to be updated
* It would be good to add appropriate feature/portrayal catalogues when ready (and signed off by IHO).
